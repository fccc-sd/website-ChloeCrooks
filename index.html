            <h2>My Best Friend</h2>
            <p>About five ago, my best friend <span class= "MyBestie">Dakota</span class= "Bestie"> moved to Maine. When she lived in our hometown in 
                Ohio, we did everything together. We went out to get ice cream, rode around town on our 
                bikes, and had many sleep overs. She's what I consider my 'ride or die' friend. This past 
                summer I was lucky enough to be able to ride with Dakota and her parents to Maine for two weeks. Those two weeks were the best time of my life. Kota and I meet all the way back in fourth grade. I don't really remember how we met but I remember spending the night at her house for the first time. Thats when I first met her brother and her parents</p>
                <p>Kota has two of the cutest dogs in the world. Mavrick is long haired German Sherperad. 
                    He's got the cutest eyes and stubby pointy ears every! Her other dog is a Poodle named
                    Cooper! He was this werid thing where he'll walk up to you and give you the cutest 
                    baby puppy eyes I have ever seen, and he'll just sit there and whine until you've pet
                    home enough of his liking.</p>

        <!--This body talks about how we got Malcolm-->
            <h2>My Pets </h2>

            <img src="IMG_8174.jpg" alt="Malcolm holding a flip flop" height="450" width="300">
                <br>
                <p>I've always wanted a <em>Bernese Mountain Dog</em> . I think they're the biggest, goofiest dog 
                    breeds in the world. To my excitment my dad had gotten me when a few months after my 
                    childhood dog died. Dolly had ment the world to me. I've had her since I was five years old. Sadly, in 2022 we had to put her down. I was so heart broken at the loss. She was my everything and now, she was gone. It was painful not having a dog in the house. Without Dolly barking at random stuff it got to be really quit. My dad and I both miss having a dog in the house. After we let ourselves heal from the loss we started looking for dogs. It took us a week but than I found the dog I knew I needed.</p>
                <p>The puppy I found was named Scott. He was only three hours away from my house. I loved
                    him and couldn't wait to pick him up. Sadly, my dad didn't put a deposite on him so 
                    someone had already got him. I was heartbroken. After that happened, my dad told me 
                    to look and that he would put a deposite on them. A few hours later I found Scotts 
                    brother, <span class="Malcolm">Malcolm</span class="Malcolm">. Right when I saw him I knew this was him, this is the one. I sent
                    it to my dad and he put in a deposite for him. A few days later, we picked him up.
                    Malcolm was the cutest puppy I have ever seen. He had these big doe baby eyes that
                        melted my heart. He also has a swift kiss which is somewhat rare on a Berner. 
                        He's the goofiest dog I've ever met. He always trys to make you laugh. For
                        example, Malcolm will go into the garge and will 99% of the time will grab my 
                        shoes and run inside the house, with my shoe in his mouth, and will run around
                        while someone tries to take the shoe back. I love Malcolm to the moon and back,
                        he's my pride and joy and because he is my dog, when I move out he's coming with me.

                        <p>Here are some things I like to do with Malcolm:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Going on long walks</li>
                            <li>Playing "fetch" outside</li>
                            <li>Play "Give me the shoes" game</li>
                            <li>Brushing him even though he hate it</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>We also have two other dogs which are Marketta's dogs. Their names are Bambi
                        and Bunni. They're both mutts so I don't know what they truly are but Bambi
                        seems like she's a terrier type mix and Bunni is apperently a mini domberman
                         mixed with Chihuahua.</p>



    
        <h2>My Family</h2>
        <Div>
            <p>My household contains my father (Brian), me, my dads girlfriend and her daughter as well as three
                dogs. My dad works at Haas Door as well as Marketta, his girlfriend. Keke, Marketta's
                daughter, just got done with collage so she is still living at my house. When <span class= "newpeople">Marketta
                and Keke</span class= "newpeople"> moved in they brought along their two small dogs named Bambi and Bunni,
                    they're both mutts.</p>

    <h2>School</h2>
    <p>The school in my home town is very small compared to Four County. So far my my 
    here has been a lot of fun. The days seem to go by faster than what they did in
    my home town. I really enjoy the program I picked, which is Computer Programming.
    My teacher,<a href="https://mrgeiger.com/index.html" title="Mr. Geigers Website">Mr. Geiger</a>, has taught
    me a lot in the first week of being at Four County. I really like this program and hope to persue
    in this type of work.</p>
