            <h2>My Best Friend</h2>
            <p>About five ago, my best friend <span class="MyBestie">Dakota</span> moved to Maine. When she lived in our hometown in 
                Ohio, we did everything together. We went out to get ice cream, rode around town on our 
                bikes, and had many sleep overs. She's what I consider my 'ride or die' friend. This past 
                summer I was lucky enough to be able to ride with Dakota and her parents to Maine for two weeks. Those two weeks were the best time of my life. Kota and I meet all the way back in fourth grade. I don't really remember how we met but I remember spending the night at her house for the first time. Thats when I first met her brother and her parents</p>
                <p>Kota has two of the cutest dogs in the world. Mavrick is long haired German Sherperad. 
                    He's got the cutest eyes and stubby pointy ears every! Her other dog is a Poodle named
                    Cooper! He was this werid thing where he'll walk up to you and give you the cutest 
                    baby puppy eyes I have ever seen, and he'll just sit there and whine until you've pet
                    home enough of his liking.</p>

            <p>My household contains my father, <span class= "MyDad">Brian</span>, me, my dads girlfriend and her daughter as well as three
                dogs. My dad works at Haas Door as well as Marketta, his girlfriend. Keke, Marketta's
                daughter, just got done with collage so she is still living at my house. When <span class= "newpeople">Marketta
                and Keke</span> moved in they brought along their two small dogs named Bambi and Bunni,
                    they're both mutts.</p>

    <h2>School</h2>
    <p>The school in my home town is very small compared to Four County. So far my my 
    here has been a lot of fun. The days seem to go by faster than what they did in
    my home town. I really enjoy the program I picked, which is Computer Programming.
    My teacher,<a href="https://mrgeiger.com/index.html" title="Mr. Geigers Website">Mr. Geiger</a>, has taught
    me a lot in the first week of being at Four County. I really like this program and hope to persue
    in this type of work.</p>
