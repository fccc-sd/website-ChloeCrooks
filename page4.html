           <h2>My Family</h2>
        <Div>
            <p>My household contains my father, <span class= "MyDad">Brian</span>, me, my dads girlfriend and her daughter as well as three
                dogs. My dad works at Haas Door as well as Marketta, his girlfriend. Keke, Marketta's
                daughter, just got done with collage so she is still living at my house. When <span class= "newpeople">Marketta
                and Keke</span> moved in they brought along their two small dogs named Bambi and Bunni,
                    they're both mutts.</p>

            <p>On my dads side I've got my Grandma Sue and Grandpa Doug. They're one of the goofiest couples on this planet. They always like
                to bicker with each other and can seem to never agree with each other. They've also got a cute little pup named Abbie.  </p>
