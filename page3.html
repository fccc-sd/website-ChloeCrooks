           <h2>My Best Friend</h2>
            <p>About five ago, my best friend <span class="MyBestie">Dakota</span> moved to Maine. When she lived in our hometown in 
                Ohio, we did everything together. We went out to get ice cream, rode around town on our 
                bikes, and had many sleep overs. She's what I consider my 'ride or die' friend. This past 
                summer I was lucky enough to be able to ride with Dakota and her parents to Maine for two weeks. Those two weeks were the best time of my life. Kota and I meet all the way back in fourth grade. I don't really remember how we met but I remember spending the night at her house for the first time. Thats when I first met her brother and her parents</p>
                <p>Kota has two of the cutest dogs in the world. Mavrick is long haired German Sherperad. 
                    He's got the cutest eyes and stubby pointy ears every! Her other dog is a Poodle named
                    Cooper! He was this werid thing where he'll walk up to you and give you the cutest 
                    baby puppy eyes I have ever seen, and he'll just sit there and whine until you've pet
                    home enough of his liking.</p>
                <p>I really miss her. Out of the five years since she's moved I've been able to fly down there twice. One two years ago in 2022 and one this
                    summer, 2024. This past time I visted she now had her drivers license so you bet we went and did stuff alone, just the two of us. I remember
                    the third last day I had there we took her pups to go get ice cream and got some ourselves too. That day was one of the happiest days I've
                    ever been in my life.
                </p>
