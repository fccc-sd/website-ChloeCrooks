            <br>
            <p>I've always wanted a <em>Bernese Mountain Dog</em> . I think they're the biggest, goofiest dog 
                breeds in the world. To my excitment my dad had gotten me when a few months after my 
                childhood dog died. Dolly had ment the world to me. I've had her since I was five years old. Sadly, in 2022 we had to put her down. I was so heart broken at the loss. She was my everything and now, she was gone. It was painful not having a dog in the house. Without Dolly barking at random stuff it got to be really quit. My dad and I both miss having a dog in the house. After we let ourselves heal from the loss we started looking for dogs. It took us a week but than I found the dog I knew I needed.</p>
            <p>The puppy I found was named Scott. He was only three hours away from my house. I loved
                him and couldn't wait to pick him up. Sadly, my dad didn't put a deposite on him so 
                someone had already got him. I was heartbroken. After that happened, my dad told me 
                to look and that he would put a deposite on them. A few hours later I found Scotts 
                brother, <span class="Malcolm">Malcolm</span>. Right when I saw him I knew this was him, this is the one. I sent
                it to my dad and he put in a deposite for him. A few days later, we picked him up.
                Malcolm was the cutest puppy I have ever seen. He had these big doe baby eyes that
                    melted my heart. He also has a swift kiss which is somewhat rare on a Berner. 
                    He's the goofiest dog I've ever met. He always trys to make you laugh. For
                    example, Malcolm will go into the garge and will 99% of the time will grab my 
                    shoes and run inside the house, with my shoe in his mouth, and will run around
                    while someone tries to take the shoe back. I love Malcolm to the moon and back,
                    he's my pride and joy and because he is my dog, when I move out he's coming with me.

                    <p>Here are some things I like to do with Malcolm:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Going on long walks</li>
                        <li>Playing "fetch" outside</li>
                        <li>Play "Give me the shoes" game</li>
                        <li>Brushing him even though he hate it</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>We also have two other dogs which are Marketta's dogs. Their names are Bambi
                    and Bunni. They're both mutts so I don't know what they truly are but Bambi
                    seems like she's a terrier type mix and Bunni is apperently a mini domberman
                     mixed with Chihuahua.</p>
